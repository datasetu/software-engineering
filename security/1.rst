Use chroot
----------

Where ever possible, use `chroot` after initialization.
After chroot, one must `chdir` to `/` and drop privileges to an unprivileged user.


Sanitize inputs
---------------

Inputs must always be treated as untrusted; and must always be santized.
Do not fire a database query, or perform any resource consuming operations unless
all the inputs are valid.

Handle any potential sql/no-sql and command injections.

API response
------------

Any API should nevre reveal any unnessary information if the user is not authenticated/authorized to.
Even the error messages should be carefully constructed not to leak any unnessary information. 

Rate limiting
-------------

All APIs especially the ones requiring authentication/authorization must be 
rate limited.

Disable debugging information in production
-------------------------------------------

Enabling debugging information in production will help an attacker to figure out
the status of an attack. It should be disabled.
