Welcome to Software Engineering for Datasetu
============================================

This document is meant as a guide for all developers of the Datasetu/ARTPARK team. It lists out best practices for:

* Designing systems
* Writing code
* Using version control systems
* Release cycles
* Planning and writing tests
* Bugfixes, patches and updates

It also lays out a formal process for development. This is by no means an exhaustive document. Au contraire, it is only meant to serve as a guide to avoid the most common pitfalls. Following the guide to the letter also does not ensure flawless design and bug free code.
